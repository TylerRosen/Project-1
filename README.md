# Song-Roulette

## Synopsis:

Have you ever wanted to quickly rate a song without having to dig for it on Spotify? Do you want to tell everyone this song is great and they're crazy for not liking it? Or tell them this song is awful, and they're crazy for liking it? Song Roulette is a fun and easy way to quickly like and dislike songs, while displaying results through graphs. Using a a mix of Firebase, AJAX, Highcharts, and Javascript, Song Roulette is a dynamic solution for rating and discovering the best of best, and the worst of the worst.
